My name is Homer Huang. I am a [software developer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_developer) and [systems analyst](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_analyst) with more than 10 years experiences. I am involved in

* Modern C++ Development (C++11, C++14)
* Java EE Development (WebLogic, JBoss)
* Software Deployment Automation (Python)
* Network Engineering (IP, RAN)
* System Integration and Performance Tuning (RHEL, KVM, OpenStack)

The site is the place where I put my technical blogs. The name `aclisp` is the name of a [Lisp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29) interpreter I wrote about 10 years ago, inspired by the article [_Roots of Lisp_](http://daiyuwen.freeshell.org/gb/rol/roots_of_lisp.html).
