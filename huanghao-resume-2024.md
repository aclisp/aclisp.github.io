# Recent Projects

1. *Youxin.cloud* A cloud-based low-code developer-oriented PaaS platform.

Youxin Cloud's PaaS low-code platform enables partners to build business applications through drag-and-drop visual programming, significantly improving development efficiency. Similar competitors include Mingdao Cloud, and Salesforce platform.

This project was developed using Java and adopted a cloud-native micro-services framework based on Spring Cloud, deployed on a Kubernetes (k8s) container management platform. As the technical expert on the project, I led the implementation of the low-code development programming language DSL. Additionally, I guided the team in completing the process orchestration engine, formula calculation engine, import/export engine, task scheduling engine, and monitoring log system. I filed three patents, one of which has been granted.

2. *Hago*. An oversea social media and voice chat Android App.

It is an app with a peak daily active user count of 7 million, operating globally with revenue primarily from Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and other regions. This project was developed using Golang and Java, leveraging YY's audio and video platform. It included the development of a proprietary real-time instant messaging (IM) channel and a custom content recommendation algorithm platform.

I led the team responsible for building the personalized content recommendation algorithm platform for live streaming rooms. This included model training, online inference, user profiling, and analysis. Through the implementation of advanced algorithms, we ultimately increased live room engagement by over 15%.

3. My open sourced side projects

    * *JLisp* - A simple Lisp interpreter for Java, which is the base of the process orchestration engine in youxin.cloud
    * *Goeasy* - Build the web real-time messaging systems in lightning speed using Go. It is a clean and open-sourced version of the IM system which I developed in Hago App.
    * *hiredispool* - Provides connection pooling and auto-reconnect for hiredis, The C driver for redis client. It is also minimalistic and easy to do customization.
    * *protodoc* - Generate a markdown document for a Protobuf file.
