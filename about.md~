My name is Homer Huang. I am a [software developer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_developer) and [systems analyst](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_analyst) with more than 10 years experience. I am involved in

* Infrastructure platform architectural design (Docker, OpenStack)
* Concurrent software design (with C/C++, Java, and Python)
* Software performance tuning (in JVM and Linux)
* IP network engineering
* Scalable deployment design

The site is the place where I put my technical blogs. The name `aclisp` is the name of a [Lisp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29) interpreter I wrote about 10 years ago, inspired by the article [_Roots of Lisp_](http://daiyuwen.freeshell.org/gb/rol/roots_of_lisp.html).
