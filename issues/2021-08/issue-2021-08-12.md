  - Tactic: Loose Coupling
Aim for loosely coupled modules. How you deploy them (as a modular monolith or microservices) is an implementation detail.
  - Tactic: One Model, One Responsibility.
Aim for loose coupling by using separate models. Write plain and obvious functions to convert between them.
  - Tactic: Generate the Repetitive Parts
Generated code gives you strong types and compile-time safety. Choose it over reflect.
  - Tactic: Explicit Structure Tags
Always fill the struct tags, even if the field names are the same.
  - Tactic: Application Layer
Dedicate a separate layer to your product’s most important code.
  - Tactic: Loosely Coupled Code
The important part isn’t the directory structure but how packages and structures reference each other.
  - Tactic: Write obvious code
Be explicit, even if it’s verbose. Use encapsulation to ensure your structs are always in a valid state.
  - Tactic: Start with the domain
Your storage methods should follow the product’s behavior. Don’t leak transactions out of them.
  - Tactic: Understand your domain
Spend time to understand how your product works and model it in the code.
